## Functional Specification  

### Background  
  
State and federal regulations require healthcare providers to report positive incidences of varying diseases and conditions, termed notifiable conditions. After a case is reported, case investigation determines: disease etiology, case management steps, potential sources of infection, management of exposure(s), and environmental measures. Traditionally, the case reporting process has been conducted via paper reports and internet-based entry systems, which are often slow, incomplete, or not reported at all due to the significant effort required of clinicians. Fortunately, electronic health record (EHR) developments encouraged by the HITECH Act make electronic case reporting (eCR) a more viable option for healthcare facilities. eCR is the electronic transmission of a case report directly from a patient’s EHR to a public health jurisdiction or healthcare intermediary, preferrably as an automated process. The aim of eCR is to reduce clinician burden, while also increasing report timeliness and completion. In turn, these improvements allow for increased detection of outbreaks, earlier intervention, and decreased disease transmission. At present, there is not an established eCR program at UW Medicine. Our system aims to mimic (pun intended) what an eCR system could look like using MIMIC III data. We also opted to merge our data system with the CDC’s National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) data in order to integrate a tracking and clinical decision support element to add further benefit for clinicians.
